# Environments

## Summary

An **Environment** is a deployment target that controls *where* MCP
servers run and *who* is allowed to deploy into it. An environment 
is a property of a catalog item: each catalog item belongs to exactly one
environment. Each environment defines:

- a **Kubernetes namespace** the server's pods are deployed into - **actual implementation deferred**
- a **default network policy** to apply to workloads in that environment.
- a **validation rule** (regex) applied to user-supplied configuration values — identical
  semantics to today's preset `validation_regex`.
- a **`restricted` flag** that gates assignment: assigning a catalog item to a restricted
  environment requires the org-wide `environment:admin` permission, while unrestricted
  environments are open to anyone who can create catalog items. The implicit **default**
  environment (catalog items with `environment_id = null`) carries the same flag, stored on the
  organization (`default_environment_restricted`); when set, creating a catalog item without
  choosing an environment is itself `environment:admin`-gated.

Environments give an org three things at once:

1. **Isolation** — different namespaces (and network policies) for sandbox vs. staging
   vs. production workloads, so a sandbox MCP cannot reach production resources.
2. **RBAC for deployment** — only users holding `environment:admin` can assign catalog items to a
   `restricted` environment (including the default environment when the org has marked it
   restricted). A regular user can experiment in a sandbox (unrestricted); assigning into a
   restricted environment such as production is an admin-gated action.
3. **Promotion** — a path to move a server up through environments (sandbox → staging →
   production) as it matures. Promotion is deliberately thin: an admin clones an existing
   server, the add-MCP form reappears pre-filled, and the admin changes the environment and
   visibility scope. There is no dedicated promotion API.

## Network policies

A **Network Policy** is an organization-scoped, reusable egress profile. It is separate from
environments so the same policy can be reused by MCP server installations today and agent
runtime/execution later.

Network policies define:

- **egress mode**:
  - `off`: no internet egress except cluster-internal traffic needed by the runtime.
  - `restricted`: allow only the selected domain preset plus explicitly allowed domains.
  - `unrestricted`: allow all egress.
- **domain preset** for restricted mode:
  - `none`: start from an empty allowlist.
  - `common_dependencies`: allow common package/source-control domains, then add custom domains.
  - `package_managers`: allow common package manager domains, then add custom domains.
- **additional allowed domains**: exact domains and wildcard subdomains such as
  `api.example.com` and `*.example.com`.
- **allowed HTTP methods**:
  - `all`
  - `read_only`: `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`.

Policy resolution:

1. An environment can reference one default network policy.
2. MCP server catalog items select an environment; they do not carry their own network policy.
3. MCP server installations inherit the policy from the catalog item's environment.
4. Effective policy order is: environment default -> built-in platform default.

UX:

- Network policy CRUD belongs on a dedicated page.
- Environment create/edit selects a default network policy.
- MCP catalog/install forms do not expose network policy controls.

Runtime mapping:

- Archestra owns Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` objects generated from the effective policy.
- Policies select only Archestra-managed workload pods for the specific installation/runtime.
- Kubernetes network policies are additive, so Archestra must generate a complete managed policy
  set for each selected workload and avoid relying on policy ordering.
- Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is L3/L4 only. The managed object enforces coarse egress isolation
  (`off` denies egress; `restricted` currently permits DNS only and fails closed for external
  egress). Domain allowlists and HTTP method restrictions require a later CNI-specific policy
  backend or egress proxy and are stored as policy intent, not enforced by vanilla Kubernetes.
- Enforcement requires a Kubernetes network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy`.
- The Helm chart service account needs RBAC for CRUD on `networkpolicies.networking.k8s.io`.

This feature is built **in parallel** with the existing "presets" feature. Presets are hidden
behind a feature flag and removed later. **There is no migration and no backward compatibility
between presets and environments.**

## User story

> A user has a **sandbox** environment to run an MCP server or agent. The sandbox cannot reach
> production resources. Once the user considers the MCP ready, they ask an admin to **promote**
> it to **staging**, where the admin verifies the server works and its guardrails behave. When
> satisfied, the admin promotes it to **production**.
